Todo:
- daemonize the csspush script, and have it start csspush and juggernaut
- update the README to be more comprehensive and have decent formatting

Future:

- Make it work in non-rails projects

Completed at ORD Sessions (June 18, 2009)
- add gem configuration to rails from setup script, pushify.rb
