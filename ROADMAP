Todo:

- pushify should add the config.gem entry to environment.rb
- an environment variable 'enable_css_push' should determine whether the pushify helper method is a no-op or not
- pushify should add the enable_css_push environment variable to development.rb
- daemonize the csspush script, and have it start csspush and juggernaut
- update the README to be more comprehensive and have decent formatting

Future:

- Make it work in non-rails projects
