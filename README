See updates you make to css files appear immediately in all of your browsers without having to refresh.

* Currently CSS-Push is only available as a plugin to rails.

How to get started:

# Install the gem

- gem install ...

# Get your rails project ready

- pushify

# add the following line to the head of a view (after the inclusion of prototype.js)

- <%= pushify %>


That's it.  Load up the page in a browser and update the CSS file in your editor.

Now open up a different browser and update the CSS.  Now you can watch the effect of you CSS updates on multiple browsers without refreshing.
